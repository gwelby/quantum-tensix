## Jim Keller's Core Architectural Principles

Based on publicly available information, Jim Keller's processor design philosophy centers on several key principles:

1. **Specialized Execution Units**
   - Purpose-built computational blocks optimized for specific workloads
   - Elimination of general-purpose overhead for better efficiency
   - Direct silicon implementation of critical algorithms

2. **Memory-Centric Architecture**
